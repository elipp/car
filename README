calc:

A command-line calculator with a shell-like user interface. Written in C.

Includes all the features one would expect in a function calculator: input history,
ans, elementary functions, variable assignment etc.

Requirements: 

 - the GNU readline library (recommended). However, the provided line-editing
   library (creatively dubbed "rl_emul") may be used instead *.

 - C99 (for strtold; only with -DLONG_DOUBLE_PRECISION though) 
	
	(see Makefile!) 

	* rl_emul is basically an interpreter of ANSI (X3.64) escape sequences.
	It is untested/unstable, and does NOT implement the whole feature-set 
	of the (GPL'd) GNU readline library.
